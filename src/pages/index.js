While many employees may be planning to donate some of their earnings from Uber's initial public offering to good causes, others may not have considered it, may not know where to start, or may need a nudge to follow through.

            'Two percent is big enough to have a significant impact, but small enough that it doesn’t feel like an untenable ask for people who might be on the fence about donating. The pledge specifies at least 2%, and if you’d like to donate more, that’s wonderful - but our biggest goal is to get people who might not have donated at all to make charitable giving an important and rewarding part of the IPO process.'

        <P>
          {
            'We’re asking signers of the pledge to donate at least 2% of their vested shares after a potential IPO, or at least 2% of the value of those shares. The pledge is a personal commitment, not a legal document, so the exact interpretation here is up to the signer - this may be a one-time donation, or an ongoing commitment as equity continues to vest. There may be tax advantages to donating actual shares, resulting in higher effective donations, but if it makes more sense to you to sell and donate a portion of the proceeds, that’s great too.'
